### BREAKING CHANGES

* We no longer fall back to fixed rate agreements if an active agreement can't be found. This was
added by mistake when people were not receiving sensors when they had moved home and therefore an
inactive house was being picked up. This means that some sensors may disapper, but these should just
be inactive meters.
* **sensor:** Latest consumption sensors are no longer available, which may cause issues anywhere they are used.

# [2.0.0](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy/compare/v1.2.0...v2.0.0) (2021-11-10)

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **api-client:** This change could cause the sensors associated with your meters to change, as they may have been
associated with a property you had moved out of
